### How this repo is organized

- Each week of the course gets its own folder; start in the week1 folder and pick day1.md
- There are many essential guides in the [guides](guides/01_intro.ipynb) section
- Please `git pull` frequently to get the latest updates - see [Guide 3 in the Guides folder](guides/03_git_and_github.ipynb) on how to pull.


### The deal you made

At the end of Day 1 in the course, I cunningly got you to agree to my terms!!

Repeat this to yourself through gritted teeth each time you're frustrated by an infrastructure roadblock..

1. I will embrace every roadblock with a positive attitude - this is where the learning happens!
2. I will be happy to roll up sleeves and dig in and do research and experiments myself and post on forums
3. I will use LLMs to help, but I recognize their blind-spots and will verify everything they suggest
4. I will post issues on Udemy, and Ed will try to help, but I understand that it’s not like code and if Ed can’t reproduce, then I’ll need to stick at it or move on
5. I’ll look for opportunities to help others in the community that are stuck

But do reach out and I'll try my very best..

### Making contributions

When you deploy projects, please make a new markdown file or python notebook in the community_contributions folder:
1. A short description of your project
2. A link to your repo
3. A link to you live, deployed project, if available
4. Anything about the experience that you'd like to share with other students

Then submit a PR so I can include it in the repo! See (Guide 3 in the Guides folder)[guides/03_git_and_github.ipynb] for more on submitting a PR.

### ABOVE ALL ELSE -

Be sure to have fun with the course! I have great stuff in store for you. There will definitely be some gnarly moments, but when you solve the issues, they will be very satisfying. And if not - [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddonner/).
